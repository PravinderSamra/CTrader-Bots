# Open hypotheses — evidence register

**Rule: nothing here changes the model until it has ≥3 trading days of evidence
pointing the same way.** One session is noise, and tuning on noise is how a
model gets worse. This file is the memory that makes that discipline survive
between sessions.

Run `python3 track.py` (in the skill's `scripts/`) to regenerate the evidence
table. Append observations below; do not rewrite history.

**Status:** 1 trading day on record (2026-08-24). Nothing is actionable.

## H1 — The budget forecasts range EXTENSION, and does it accurately?

**Claim.** `remaining_budget` predicts how much further the day's high-low range
will grow. It does *not* predict how far price will travel.

**Why it matters.** It changes what the number is *for*. Read as "movement
left", `EXHAUSTED` says stand down. Read correctly it says the extremes are
probably in — expect movement *between* them.

**Evidence so far (1 day).**

| Scan | Budget | Extension | Traversal | Error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 Aug 13:45 NY_OPEN | 0.0 | **5.3** | 284.4 | **+5.3** |
| 24 Aug 12:40 PRE_NY | 88.7 | 168.5 | 290.9 | +79.8 |
| 24 Aug 09:37 LONDON | 88.7 | 168.5 | 334.7 | +79.8 |
| 24 Aug 08:28 LONDON | 88.7 | 168.5 | 334.7 | +79.8 |

Mean error **+61.2pts** (range grew more than budgeted).

**Read.** At the exhausted point the forecast was near-exact. Early-session it
ran ~1.9× light. Traversal exceeded the budget every time — which is the point:
they measure different things.

**Threshold.** 3+ days. If the exhausted-point accuracy holds and early-session
error persists, the fix is a time-of-day correction, not a blanket multiplier.

**Status: OBSERVING.**

## H2 — At LOW_FUEL / EXHAUSTED, does fading the extremes beat continuation?

**Claim.** If the range will not extend, price must turn at the extremes, so the
higher-probability trade is a fade back into the range — even when the gamma
regime favours continuation.

**Why it matters.** This directly contradicts the gamma-regime strategy call in
those conditions, and the brief now says so in words. If it is wrong, the brief
is actively misleading on exhausted days.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** 24 Aug 13:45: `EXHAUSTED`, 0pt budget, price at the
day's low, bias **−12 STRONGLY BEARISH** (continuation). Price fell 30.6pts
further, bottomed, then rallied 253.8 and closed +147 above the scan. **The fade
was the trade.** One observation.

**Threshold.** 3+ instances of `LOW_FUEL`/`EXHAUSTED`-at-extreme. Record each
time: did price extend, or reverse?

**Status: OBSERVING.** The wording change was made because it is a *definitional*
consequence of H1, not a calibration — but the empirical claim still needs proving.

---

## H3 — Does the bias engine over-commit at range extremes?

**Claim.** With fuel exhausted and price at the day's extreme, a continuation
score should be capped rather than allowed to reach ±12.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** The −12 above was the strongest reading of the
session, produced at the exact low. Follows from the documented design choice
that fuel "reports, never votes".

**Threshold.** 3+ instances. If H2 confirms, this may be redundant — the fuel
wording may already do the work without touching the score.

**Status: OBSERVING. Do not implement.**

---

## H4 — Is the gamma flip a reliable magnet / settlement level?

**Claim.** Price gravitates back to the flip, making it useful as a target and
as trade invalidation.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** 24 Aug: flip published at 29,049.6 on the 13:45
scan; session closed **29,050.7 — 1.1 points away**, after trading well below it
and reversing.

**Threshold.** 5+ days (this is a distributional claim, so it needs more).
Record the close-to-flip distance each day.

**Status: OBSERVING.** Striking, but one coincidence proves nothing.

---

## H5 — Does the budget under-read early in the session and self-correct?

**Claim.** Error is largest early and shrinks as the day progresses.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** Early (3 scans) mean error **+79.8**; late (1 scan)
**+5.3**.

**Threshold.** 3+ days. If it holds, the fix is a time-of-day term on the
budget — not a flat multiplier, which would break the accurate late reads.

**Status: OBSERVING.**

---

## H6 — Is the level board producing clean reactions?

**Claim.** Published levels are reaction points, not just descriptive lines.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** Hit rate **0.56–0.69** depending on dedupe. Most
touched levels graded "traded both sides — chopped around it" rather than a
clean stall or rejection.

**Threshold.** 5+ days, then break it down by level *type* — if session
extremes react cleanly and, say, PD-mid never does, the board should drop the
latter.

**Status: OBSERVING.**

## Resolved / withdrawn

**W1 — "Fuel is systematically too tight; recalibrate."** *Withdrawn 2026-08-24.*
Rested on grading the budget against price traversal instead of range extension,
which manufactured a 3.8× under-estimate from an accurate forecast. The review
engine was fixed; the proposal was wrong.

**W2 — The 2026-08-20 data point.** *Withdrawn 2026-08-24.* It came from a
backdated journal entry created to test the review loop and deleted immediately
after. It was then cited as one of "three independent sessions" — exactly the
archive corruption this process exists to prevent. Never cite a synthetic entry.

## Housekeeping carried forward

- **Deduplicate near-identical scans.** Four landed within five minutes during
  testing. `track.py` now collapses scans inside a 15-minute window; the raw
  journal keeps them all.
- **Exclude incomplete sessions.** A scan 56 minutes into a new trading day was
  being graded "extension 0.0, traversal 26.1". `track.py` now requires ~12.5h
  of bars before a day enters the evidence.
- **Weekend PREP scans** never enter statistics (`is_trading_day: false`).
