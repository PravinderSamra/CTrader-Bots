# Open hypotheses — evidence register

**Rule: nothing here changes the model until it has ≥3 trading days of evidence
pointing the same way.** One session is noise, and tuning on noise is how a
model gets worse. This file is the memory that makes that discipline survive
between sessions.

Run `python3 track.py` (in the skill's `scripts/`) to regenerate the evidence
table. Append observations below; do not rewrite history.

**Status:** 2 trading days on record (2026-08-24, 2026-08-25). Nothing is
actionable — the threshold is 3.

## H1 — The budget forecasts range EXTENSION, and does it accurately?

**Claim.** `remaining_budget` predicts how much further the day's high-low range
will grow. It does *not* predict how far price will travel.

**Why it matters.** It changes what the number is *for*. Read as "movement
left", `EXHAUSTED` says stand down. Read correctly it says the extremes are
probably in — expect movement *between* them.

**Evidence so far (1 day).**

| Scan | Budget | Extension | Traversal | Error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 Aug 13:45 NY_OPEN | 0.0 | **5.3** | 284.4 | **+5.3** |
| 24 Aug 12:40 PRE_NY | 88.7 | 168.5 | 290.9 | +79.8 |
| 24 Aug 09:37 LONDON | 88.7 | 168.5 | 334.7 | +79.8 |
| 24 Aug 08:28 LONDON | 88.7 | 168.5 | 334.7 | +79.8 |
| **25 Aug 13:04 PRE_NY** | 12.0 | **0.4** | 256.5 | **−11.6** |

Mean error **+46.6pts** (range grew more than budgeted).

**Read.** At the exhausted point the forecast was near-exact — twice now. On 25
Aug the budget said 12pts of extension remained; price ran to a marginal new
high **0.4pts** above the London high, reversed, and closed 130pts lower. The
range did not extend. Meanwhile price travelled **256.5pts inside** it. Early
LONDON scans still run ~1.9× light. Traversal exceeded the budget every time —
which is the point: they measure different things.

*Excluded:* 25 Aug 21:56 OVERNIGHT (budget 0.0 vs extension 371.0). Its fuel was
measured across the 21:00 UTC rollover and described the *previous* day's
finished range — a corrupt input, not a failed forecast. Counting it would have
dragged the mean from 46.6 to 100.7 and invented a systematic bias out of a bug.
See D1 below.

**Threshold.** 3+ days. If the exhausted-point accuracy holds and early-session
error persists, the fix is a time-of-day correction, not a blanket multiplier.

**Status: OBSERVING — 2 of 3 days.** The exhausted-point claim is now 2-for-2
and looking strong; one more clean session decides it.

## H2 — At LOW_FUEL / EXHAUSTED, does fading the extremes beat continuation?

**Claim.** If the range will not extend, price must turn at the extremes, so the
higher-probability trade is a fade back into the range — even when the gamma
regime favours continuation.

**Why it matters.** This directly contradicts the gamma-regime strategy call in
those conditions, and the brief now says so in words. If it is wrong, the brief
is actively misleading on exhausted days.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** 24 Aug 13:45: `EXHAUSTED`, 0pt budget, price at the
day's low, bias **−12 STRONGLY BEARISH** (continuation). Price fell 30.6pts
further, bottomed, then rallied 253.8 and closed +147 above the scan. **The fade
was the trade.** One observation.

**25 Aug 13:04:** `EXHAUSTED`, 12pt budget, bias **0 / NEUTRAL** (no call). Price
made a 0.4pt new high, then sold off 256pts to 29,086 and closed mid-range at
29,212.9. Fading the extreme was again the trade; the engine issued no
directional call, so this is evidence for the *fuel* claim but not against the
bias engine. Two observations.

**Threshold.** 3+ instances of `LOW_FUEL`/`EXHAUSTED`-at-extreme. Record each
time: did price extend, or reverse?

**Status: OBSERVING.** The wording change was made because it is a *definitional*
consequence of H1, not a calibration — but the empirical claim still needs proving.

---

## H3 — Does the bias engine over-commit at range extremes?

**Claim.** With fuel exhausted and price at the day's extreme, a continuation
score should be capped rather than allowed to reach ±12.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** The −12 above was the strongest reading of the
session, produced at the exact low. Follows from the documented design choice
that fuel "reports, never votes".

**Threshold.** 3+ instances. If H2 confirms, this may be redundant — the fuel
wording may already do the work without touching the score.

**Status: OBSERVING. Do not implement.**

---

## H4 — Is the gamma flip a reliable magnet / settlement level?

**Claim.** Price gravitates back to the flip, making it useful as a target and
as trade invalidation.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** 24 Aug: flip published at 29,049.6 on the 13:45
scan; session closed **29,050.7 — 1.1 points away**, after trading well below it
and reversing.

**25 Aug:** flip published at 28,976.3 on the 13:04 scan; session closed
**29,212.9 — 236.6 points away**, and price never traded down to it (session low
29,086.1, still 110pts above). Clearly *not* a magnet on this day. One hit, one
miss.

**Threshold.** 5+ days (this is a distributional claim, so it needs more).
Record the close-to-flip distance each day.

**Status: OBSERVING.** 24 Aug's 1.1pt finish now looks like the coincidence it
was warned to be. Do not use the flip as a target on this evidence.

---

## H5 — Does the budget under-read early in the session and self-correct?

**Claim.** Error is largest early and shrinks as the day progresses.

**Evidence so far (2 days).** Early (4 scans) mean error **+56.9**; late (1 scan)
**+5.3**. The 25 Aug PRE_NY scan came in at **−11.6** — the first *over*-read on
record, and it arrived late in the range's life rather than early, which is
consistent with the claim.

**Threshold.** 3+ days. If it holds, the fix is a time-of-day term on the
budget — not a flat multiplier, which would break the accurate late reads.

**Status: OBSERVING.**

---

## H6 — Is the level board producing clean reactions?

**Claim.** Published levels are reaction points, not just descriptive lines.

**Evidence so far (2 days).** Hit rate **0.58** across 5 graded scans. On 25 Aug
both published levels (29,299.6 structural call wall, 29,249.6 options shelf)
graded "traded both sides — chopped around it". That is now the dominant
outcome, and it has a plausible cause: both days were long-gamma/pinning
regimes, where chop *is* the correct behaviour at a level. Worth splitting the
eventual breakdown by gamma regime as well as by level type.

**Threshold.** 5+ days, then break it down by level *type* — if session
extremes react cleanly and, say, PD-mid never does, the board should drop the
latter.

**Status: OBSERVING.**

---

## H7 — Is the overnight gamma flip stable enough to trade off?

**Claim.** The flip published on an overnight/pre-London scan is unreliable,
because the chain reprices and rolls before the session that would use it.

**Why it matters.** The flip decides the *regime label*, which decides which of
the two strategies the brief recommends. If it moves several hundred points
overnight, an overnight regime call is close to worthless.

**Evidence so far (1 day).** 24 Aug 21:56 published flip **29,271.0** with price
29,051.2 → "BELOW flip, SHORT gamma, dealers amplify" and **−3** on the bias
score, the single largest bearish component. By 25 Aug 13:04 the flip was
**28,976.3** with price 29,252.8 → "ABOVE flip, LONG gamma". The regime label
**inverted overnight**, and it inverted because the flip moved **295 points**,
not because price moved. The strategy recommendation inverted with it
(Strategy 2 → Strategy 1). The overnight scan's direction call was WRONG (−15
STRONGLY BEARISH, day closed +140).

**Threshold.** 3+ days. Record the overnight flip and the next-day pre-NY flip;
measure the drift.

**Status: OBSERVING. Do not implement.** If the drift is consistently large the
fix is to *widen the confidence band* on overnight regime calls, or suppress the
gamma component before the cash open — not to change the flip maths, which is
sound.

## Resolved / withdrawn

**W1 — "Fuel is systematically too tight; recalibrate."** *Withdrawn 2026-08-24.*
Rested on grading the budget against price traversal instead of range extension,
which manufactured a 3.8× under-estimate from an accurate forecast. The review
engine was fixed; the proposal was wrong.

**W2 — The 2026-08-20 data point.** *Withdrawn 2026-08-24.* It came from a
backdated journal entry created to test the review loop and deleted immediately
after. It was then cited as one of "three independent sessions" — exactly the
archive corruption this process exists to prevent. Never cite a synthetic entry.

---

## Defects found and fixed (not hypotheses — these were bugs)

**D1 — Fuel measured across the 21:00 UTC day rollover.** *Found and fixed
2026-08-25.* The feed goes quiet over the daily roll, so a scan in that window
found zero bars for the new trading day. `levels_fuel.run()` silently fell back
to the last completed **daily** bar — i.e. it served yesterday's finished range
as today's. The 24 Aug 21:56 scan therefore printed *"range 530.9, 117.7% used,
EXHAUSTED, 0.0 budget"* **56 minutes into a session that went on to build a
397pt range**, telling the reader the day was over before it had begun.

Not a calibration question and so not subject to the 3-day rule — a range that
does not exist yet is *unknowable*, not *exhausted*. `levels_fuel` now reports a
new `SESSION_PENDING` state with the full ADR as budget, and the brief says in
words that there is no fuel read yet. `track.py` quarantines any pre-fix scan
carrying the signature (>100% ADR used within 90 minutes of the roll) so it
cannot enter the statistics.

It did **not** affect the direction call: fuel reports and never votes, so the
bias score was untouched. The two failures on 24–25 Aug overnight are
independent — this one and H7.

## Housekeeping carried forward

- **Deduplicate near-identical scans.** Four landed within five minutes during
  testing. `track.py` now collapses scans inside a 15-minute window; the raw
  journal keeps them all.
- **Exclude incomplete sessions.** A scan 56 minutes into a new trading day was
  being graded "extension 0.0, traversal 26.1". `track.py` now requires ~12.5h
  of bars before a day enters the evidence.
- **Weekend PREP scans** never enter statistics (`is_trading_day: false`).
- **Quarantine corrupt inputs, don't grade them.** A scan whose *input* was
  wrong is not a forecast that failed. `track.py` now prints an EXCLUDED block
  so the exclusions stay visible rather than silent.
